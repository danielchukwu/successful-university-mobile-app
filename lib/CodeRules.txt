Functions
- callback functions should be abstracted into their own functions (improves readability)
- the names of functions that help us navigate to other pages (screens) should follow the below format
  e.g navigateTo<ScreenName>

Widgets
- Each Widget line should not contain over 70 lines of code (for sake of readability)
  - Best case    (less than 50 lines of code)
  - Average case (less than 60 lines of code)
  - Hmm case     (less than 70 lines of code)
  - Worst case   (above 70 lines of code)
